# Flight Performance & Aviation Analytics

This project analyzes **flight operations, delays, cancellations, route efficiency, and passenger experience** to help airlines and airports improve performance. Using **SQL** for querying and **Power BI** for visualization, the analysis transforms raw aviation data into actionable insights for decision-makers.

##  Project Overview

The aviation industry operates in a highly dynamic environment where **efficiency, punctuality, and cost management** are critical. AeroStat Airlines, a global airline, faces challenges in flight punctuality, cancellations, route efficiency, and customer satisfaction.

This project applies **SQL queries** and **Power BI dashboards** to uncover trends in flight delays, cancellations, busiest routes/airports, and passenger service quality, enabling data-driven decisions.

##  Tools Used

* **SQL** â€“ Querying and analyzing flight data
